## Our Approach

1. **Organization**
  Frontend development:
  - Mitch: responsible for Routing, dealing with components of Batch and Listing.
  - Renice: responsible for User Authentication and User components.
  
2.  Backend development:
  - Gloria: responsible for session and user schema/ validation and authentication.
  - Bairong: responsible for Batch, the nested Listing schema / validation & styling.
  
3. **General approach**
- Initial planning
  A lot of time was spent on wireframing and finalizing our user story. From there, we moved on to designing a database that could make our vision a possibility. We research heavily on unfamiliar topics before we proceeded with our project. (e.g. database relationships or user authentication)
- Communication
  We maintained constant communications with one another to keep every one for the purpose of updates and working through problems. Trello was also used to help us keep track of our team's progress for the project.
  
## Major hurdles
1) Deciding the data relationship between our Batch and Listing Schemas:
  We were unfamiliar with dealing with related data schemas that could potentially required us to make sophisticated operations in order to properly update our databases. In the end, we decided to just proceed with using embedded documents due to the ease of usage.
 
2) POST / PUT actions from the frontend and embedded documents. -------- MITCH HERE

3) User Authentication & protected routes:
  Had major problems dealing with this issue. ---RENICE PLEASE EXPLAIN ISSUE --- Due to a lack of time, we decided to try using useContext/useReducer for Authentication and --- RENICE URS HERE ----
  
4) Doing cross documents updates. (Referencing Docs).  --- GLORIA HERE ----
